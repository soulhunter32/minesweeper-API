# Minesweeper API

Minesweeper API is a Java REST API that emulates the classic and well-known [Minesweeper game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)), developed with a wide range of technologies:
- Java 8
- Spring Boot 2 (Spring REST + Spring Security + JPA + Lombok)
- JWT
- Swagger 2 + Springfox UI
- JUnit 4 + Mockito 2 + PowerMock
- Maven
- Kotlin Client - Kotlin v1.3.72
- Deployed on AWS Beanstalk
- [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/) documentation hosted on AWS Amplify

## Test environment
The API has been deployed on AWS Beanstalk and can be accessed in the following URL:
http://minesweeperapi-env-1.eba-yzizmngx.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

## GitHub Repository
https://github.com/soulhunter32/minesweeper-API

## Project Structure
The application consist of a main Java API core and a Kotlin client to consume it, split into a multi-module Maven project. 
* API Core Module: `api-core`
* Kotlin Client Module: `kotlin-client`

## Features
* Ability to create a new user for the game. Multiple users can be created, each with a set of games
* Ability to crate a new game for a specific user with a set of settings:
  * Width size
  * Height size
  * Amount of mines
* A user can start multiple new games, but the elapsed time will continue till the game ends.
* Ability to reveal a cell based on X and Y coordinates
* Ability to flag a cell based on X and Y coordinates and a type.
The flag type can be `RED_FLAG` or `QUESTION_MARK`
* Time tracking, each game has a start, end and elapsed time set once the game has finished (win/lost game)
* Game difficulty level can be also configured, but it's not available for user access

## Installation
* Clone the repository:
   * `git clone https://github.com/soulhunter32/minesweeper-API.git`
* Build the app
    * `cd minesweeper-API`
    * `mvn clean install`

## Run API server
* The API project contains an embedded Tomcat server. To run it, execute the following commands:
   * `cd /api-core`
   * `mvn spring-boot:run`
* The API entry point will be accessible on http://localhost:5000/minesweeper
 
## API Documentation
The API documentation can be accessed on http://localhost:5000/minesweeper/swagger-ui.htmlÂ¨

## Game Instructions
* In order to start a game, a new user must be crated. If the user does not exist and a new game or a flag/reveal instruction is sent, an error message will appear.
* Once the user is created, a new game must be sent with its settings: `board width, height and amount of mines`. If the amount of mines exceeds the default 35% of the board size, an error will appear.
* From now on, the user can send cell reveal/flag coordinates to a game Ability to reveal a cell based on X and Y coordinates
* Ability to flag a cell based on X and Y coordinates and a type.
The flag type can be `RED_FLAG` or `QUESTION_MARK`
Game difficulty level can be also configured, but it's not available for user access

## Endpoints
### New User
Creates a new user for the  `username` supplied in the request.

    POST /minesweeper/users

#### Request
- User
```json
{"username": "user01"}
```
#### Response
- User
```json
{"id":"1", "username": "user01"}
```

### New Game
Creates a game with the board settings provided, for the user  `userId` supplied in the path. 
It populates the board with the settings provided, creating a X*Y matrix using the width and height from the settings.
It also randomly populates the mines and completes the adjacent information for each cell.

    POST /minesweeper/users/{userId}

#### Request
- Board Settings
```json
{"width": 10, "height": 10, "totalMines": 35}
```
#### Response
- Game
